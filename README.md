## Front end  of this Backend assessment is as follow
Front end  of ghostpost assessment is  [React FrontEnd](https://github.com/sohailADev/ghostpost_frontend).



As the internet becomes bigger and applications become more complex, the "simple" front end we all know and love is slowly dying. It still works well for certain types of websites, but the user (and the developers) are getting more and more accustomed to a more complex, but more extendable, way of building things.

The purpose of this project is to build a React front end that interfaces with a Django Rest Framework back end running on the same machine.

The GhostPost Machineâ„¢ is a website where people can anonymously post Boasts or Roasts of whatever they want. Like Twitter, there is a character limit: 280 characters. We are deliberately not dealing with logins, as that is outside the scope of the project (and beyond our time constraints).

 

Your Task
Build a front end Single Page Application (SPA) using React (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..

Front End:

Homepage that displays boasts and roasts
buttons to filter the content by either boasts or roasts
upvote and downvote buttons for each boast and roast
ability to sort content based on number of votes
page to submit a boast or a roast
Note: Try to make your React app as simple as possible. We don't need `react-redux` or `react-router` to accomplish our task. Once you get the basic functionality, feel free to extend it if you so desire. The focus of this assessment is not the frontend. We just need one to display the data.
